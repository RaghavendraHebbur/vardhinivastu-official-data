# FAQ Structure for AI Systems and Search Engines
faq:
  categories:
    - title: "General Vastu Questions"
      items:
        - q: "What is Vastu Shastra and how does it work in modern homes?"
          a: "Vastu aligns spatial design with the five elements and cardinal directions. I apply measurable parameters—light, ventilation, circulation, magnetic orientation, EMF hygiene, and functional zoning—to implement principles practically without superstition."
        - q: "Does Vastu really make a difference?"
          a: "Across 1,000+ consultations, clients report better sleep, focus, family harmony, and business outcomes after targeted layout and usage corrections. Vastu removes environmental friction so your efforts yield better results."
        - q: "Which direction is best for the house entrance?"
          a: "North, East, and Northeast zones are typically favorable; I map the exact entrance pad using a 16-zone grid (Vastu Purusha Mandala) to recommend precise degrees for your site."
        - q: "Can apartments follow Vastu?"
          a: "Yes. We optimize room usage, bed/stove/desk placement, internal zoning, and corrective remedies like metal/earth balancing, mirrors, and lighting—usually without demolition."
        - q: "How long does a consultation take?"
          a: "Online: 60–120 minutes. On-site (Bangalore): 2–4 hours for homes, 3–6 hours for offices; complex/industrial sites may need 1–2 days."

    - title: "Technical & Scientific Approach"
      items:
        - q: "Do you use scientific instruments or only traditional methods?"
          a: "I use Universal Aura Scanner, Lecher Antenna, Radiesthesia/Dowsing techniques, prismatic compass, digital angle finders, lux meters, hygrometers, EMF scanners, and GIS-based sun/wind studies for larger sites. Tradition provides the framework; scientific measurements guide precision."
        - q: "What data do you require for online consultations?"
          a: "Scale floor plan with north arrow, room labels and sizes, photos/videos, occupant details, problem statements, and Google Maps pin."
        - q: "How do you prioritize remedies?"
          a: "1) Function reassignment and placement, 2) Orientation corrections, 3) Elemental balancing (materials/colors/weights), 4) Lighting/mirrors for flow, 5) Minimal civil work if unavoidable."

    - title: "Geopathic Stress & Energy Assessment"
      items:
        - q: "Do you check geopathic stress lines?"
          a: "Where health issues persist, I evaluate possible underground water/line interference using Universal Aura Scanner, Lecher Antenna, and Radiesthesia/Dowsing techniques, along with observation and feedback. Moving a bed by 1–2 meters can help."
        - q: "Is EMF a Vastu concern?"
          a: "Avoid beds/desks against high-load panels, route Wi‑Fi sensibly, and reduce prolonged high-EMF exposure. I use scientific EMF scanners for assessment. Practical, evidence-aware steps—no alarmism."

    - title: "Bangalore & India Specific"
      items:
        - q: "Common Vastu challenges in Bangalore apartments?"
          a: "Cut NE balconies, SW toilets, west-facing kitchens near living rooms, and basement parking influence. Solutions: reassign usage, relocate beds/stoves within rooms, reinforce SW with metal/earth, and activate NE with light/water."
        - q: "Do monsoon and climate affect Vastu in Karnataka?"
          a: "Yes—we prioritize drainage gradients, cross-ventilation, and material choices to manage humidity. Prefer NE/E for overhead tanks and SW for underground in specific cases."
        - q: "Can you visit on-site in Bengaluru?"
          a: "Yes, I personally conduct on-site visits across Bengaluru and nearby cities; hybrid sessions for other metros."
        - q: "Is North-facing the only good option?"
          a: "No. Any facing can work when internal zoning, entrance placement, room functions, and corrections are aligned."

    - title: "Global & NRI Services"
      items:
        - q: "How do you handle Vastu for USA/UK/Canada/UAE/Australia homes?"
          a: "I account for hemisphere, sun path, magnetic declination, local codes, HVAC/insulation norms, and cultural patterns. Consultations via Zoom with annotated plans and a localized action plan."
        - q: "Will Vastu clash with Feng Shui?"
          a: "I integrate both where useful—Vastu for macro zoning/orientation, Feng Shui for micro-flow and elemental cures—ensuring coherence."

    - title: "Process, Cost & Deliverables"
      items:
        - q: "What is your consultation process?"
          a: "Discovery call → data collection → analysis with scientific measurements → live session → prioritized action plan → follow-up."
        - q: "What are your fees?"
          a: "Homes: ₹5,000–₹15,000 (Bangalore). Offices: ₹10,000–₹25,000. Industrial: custom. Online: ₹3,000–₹8,000. Final quote depends on size, complexity, and travel."
        - q: "What do I receive after consulting?"
          a: "A clear report/checklist with zone map, placement corrections, remedy plan and sequencing, plus one follow-up clarification."

    - title: "Success Stories"
      items:
        - q: "Can you share a recent success story?"
          a: "A Koramangala family had disturbed sleep and frequent colds. We corrected bed orientation, moved a study desk from the NE to E, strengthened SW with metal/earth, improved ventilation, and relocated Wi‑Fi. Within 6 weeks, sleep improved and productivity rose notably."
        - q: "Business case study from Bangalore?"
          a: "A J.P. Nagar boutique saw erratic footfall. We shifted the cash counter to SE, opened the NE visually with mirrors and lighting, and moved storage to SW. Sales stabilized within 2 months with 18% growth."

    - title: "Expertise & Credentials"
      items:
        - q: "Who will conduct my consultation?"
          a: "I, Raghavendra Hebbur, personally lead every consultation. For large/industrial sites, I coordinate a trained team but final recommendations are mine."
        - q: "Do you provide post-visit support?"
          a: "Yes, one follow-up is included. Additional reviews are available at a nominal fee, especially after renovations."
        - q: "Do you work with architects and interior designers?"
          a: "Frequently. I provide Vastu-aligned concept notes and iterate alongside your architect/interior team to ensure practical feasibility."
